# Clustering

This is the notes from 'Cluster Analysis in Data Mining'

###Calculation of dissimlarity Matrix

One can calculate the dissimilarity matrix using [daisy](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/cluster/html/daisy.html)
from the `cluster` package in R

###DBSCAN - A Density based Clustering Algorithm 
(excerpts from a [paper](http://www.academia.edu/8142139/Density_Based_Clustering_with_DBSCAN_and_OPTICS_-_Literature_Review)

Clustering with density-based algorithms identifies regions in which objects (also referred to as points) are close to one another. This closeness is understood in terms of proximity (dissimilarity) measure best suited for a given set of attributes. In that respect, the variations of density in a data set are being estimated based on the number of points in a neighbourhood of every single object belonging to that data set.

**Definition:** É›-neighboorhood
